# Story
In Class 30, you have learnt to use the vanishing effect for a pig and use keyboard events to
attach the bird back to the sling in the Angry Birds game.
In this project, you will have to practice and apply what you have learnt in the class and
continue adding more functionality to the Tower Siege game.
